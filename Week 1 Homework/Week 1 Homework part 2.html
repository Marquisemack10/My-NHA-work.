  <p> <h1> A Beautiful Day </h1> </p>
  <p> <h2> By: Unkown </h2> </p>
    <p> <h3> There's not a clound today <br>
                just a sky of blue      <br>
             As the sun shines bright   <br>
                It feels so new         <br>
                <br>
            As you walk down the street <br>
            You can see smiles from all around <br>
            It looks like everyone <br>
            Came to town <br>
              <br>
            To enjoy the summer's day <br>
            And let time stand still <br>
            For a little while <br>
            Just until <br>
    </h3> </p>
